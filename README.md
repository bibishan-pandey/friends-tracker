# friends-tracker
This project was submitted as a Bachelor's final year project with the title of:
#### “Android Application for Real Time People Tracking with Location Based Services and Geo-fencing”
This project was created to develop an android application which helps user to locate
different other users/friends with the feature called location sharing mode. Real time location sharing and
alert service is available with the help cloud database (firebase). The location sharing mode of a
particular user if is turned on then the connected users can view the location of that
user. The users have an option for turning off the location sharing mode. While
tracking other user, the tracking user can create a boundary on the map that acts as a
geo-fence for the tracked user. If the tracked user gets inside or outside the boundary i.e. geo-fence,
the tracking user gets notification.
